Essential features of a real-world blockchain:

    Consensus algorithm:
	The proof_of_work() method implements a simple proof of work algorithm. 
	This algorithm requires nodes to solve a difficult mathematical problem in order to add new blocks to the blockchain.
 	This makes it difficult for attackers to tamper with the blockchain.
    Peer-to-peer networking: 
	The connect_to_node() and broadcast_block() methods allow nodes to connect to each other and share blocks.
 	This ensures that the blockchain is decentralized and not controlled by any single entity.
    Transaction validation: 
	The is_valid_transaction_data() method validates the transaction data before it is added to a block.
 	This helps to prevent fraudulent transactions from being added to the blockchain.
    Blockchain data structure:
	The Blockchain class uses an ordered dictionary to store the chain of blocks.
 	This data structure allows for efficient access to blocks and makes it difficult to tamper with the blockchain.
    Cryptography:
	The blockchain uses cryptography to ensure the security of the network.
 	For example, the calculate_hash() method uses a cryptographic hash function to generate a unique hash for each block.
  	This hash makes it difficult to hack.
