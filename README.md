scalable modular serverless blockchain

This is a basic implementation of a scalable modular serverless blockchain. To make it more scalable, you could add more miners to the mining pool. You could also use a cloud provider that offers a serverless computing platform, such as AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, or Google Cloud Functions. This would allow you to scale your blockchain up or down based on demand without having to worry about managing servers.

To make the blockchain more modular, you could break it up into different components, such as a blockchain component, a mining pool component, and a miner component. This would allow you to easily add or remove features from the blockchain without having to rewrite the entire codebase.
