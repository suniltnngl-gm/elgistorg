scalable modular serverless blockchain

To make this blockchain scalable, you can add more miners to the mining pool. You can also use a cloud provider that offers a serverless computing platform, such as AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, or Google Cloud Functions. This will allow you to scale your blockchain up or down based on demand without having to worry about managing servers.

To make the blockchain modular, you could break it up into different components, such as a blockchain component, a mining pool component, and a miner component. This would allow you to easily add or remove features from the blockchain without having to rewrite the entire codebase.

To deploy this blockchain, you can use the AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM), the Azure Functions Core Tools, or the Google Cloud Functions CLI.
