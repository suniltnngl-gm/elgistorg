# Code

In this updated code, the   send_message()   method in the   Messaging   class adds a new block to the blockchain with the message as the transaction data. The   receive_messages()   method retrieves all messages from the blockchain.

Similarly, the   store_data()   method in the   Storage   class adds a new block to the blockchain with the data as the transaction data. The   retrieve_data()   method retrieves all data from the blockchain.

The   Network   class now has a   peers   attribute to store connected peers. The   connect_to_peers()   method takes a list of peers and adds them to the   peers   attribute. The   broadcast_message()   method sends the message to all peers in the network by calling their   send_message()   methods.

These updates make the code more complete and showcase a basic implementation of a blockchain with messaging, storage, and network functionalities.
